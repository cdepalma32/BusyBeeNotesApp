  ## Description
  A note taker application which uses an Express.js back end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
  This application shows the build of the back end, while connecting it to the front end.  
  Functionality includes: entering a new note (title & text), a "clear form" option to erase the notes before saving,
  the option to save a note, as well as deleting an existing note.  Viewing previously saved notes and having them
  display is another option for the user.
